<p>I love getting my hands dirty and making things. Here are some of the cool projects and ideas I have worked on. They are a culmination of the skills I have acquired in Electronics and Computer Science along the way.</p>
<p>As usual, if you have any questions or comments, or if you would like to work on a project with me, contact me <a href = "/contact"><b>here</b></a>.</p>
