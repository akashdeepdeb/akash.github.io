  I decided to make this section for one reason - to share the resources I used for learning subjects in Math, CS and ECE. These are all the important courses I have taken at UIUC and elsewhere. You'll find materials and resources that should help you for them. 
  I have not provided the links for some textbooks and sources to avoid copyright issues. However, if you have any questions about where to find/get the textbooks, feel free to contact me <a href = "/contact"><b>here</b></a>.

   <p><b>Course Review</b><br> When I was in high-school, I didn't actually take this course since I was in a different curriculum. However, I self-studied the course from Coursera and the Barron's books. If you're reading this and are in high-school, I highly recommend taking it, as getting a '5' is not very hard and
   it allows you to get placed out of the strict Calc I & II requirements and jump directly to Calc III (Calc I, II can easily be self-studied, so you don't have to spend 1 or 2 semester(s) with them.)</p>

   <p><b>Course Review</b><br>
   As with Calc BC, I hadn't taken this course formally (just the test.) I mostly prepared for it from the Barron's book and took time off from school to 
   get help from professors. Other than that I watched MIT OCW's lectures online and Rice University's online edX course - both of which were extremely helpful. Doing 5-7 practice tests (basically, till your concepts are clear) is probably the best way to get a 5 in the test.

   <p><b>Course Review</b><br>
   I was (and still am) really interested in Classical Mechanics. Indeed, I had actually considered taking the class.
   However, in the last few days I remembered that I had signed up for the test and realized that the deadline to drop the test had passed. So, I was left with one choice (not much of a 'choice' really.) I had 2 days to prepare. <br>
   In my Junior year of high-school, I had formally taken MIT's 8.01 Classical Mechanics on edX, taught by <em>the</em> great MIT professor, Walter Lewin. It was perhaps the best course I have ever taken and 8.01's course quality is still unparalleled. Anyways, with 2 days left to prepare, I re-viewed all 36 hours of Classical Mechanics videos on YouTube and somehow passed the proficiency test. 
   A stroke of luck you say? Maybe. Maybe not. I can say one thing. When I took the test, I knew I had given many right answers because I got those answers mostly on first go. All in all, the test wasn't very hard. So, to prepare for it, you can watch Walter Lewin's lecture videos on YouTube.
