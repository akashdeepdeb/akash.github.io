  I decided to make this section for one reason - to share the resources I used for learning subjects in Math, CS and ECE. These are all the important courses I have taken at UIUC and elsewhere. You'll find materials and resources that should help you for them. 
  I have not provided the links for some textbooks and sources to avoid copyright issues. However, if you have any questions about where to find/get the textbooks, feel free to contact me <a href = "/contact"><b>here</b></a>.

   <p><b>Course Review</b><br> When I was in high-school, I didn't actually take this course since I was in a different curriculum. However, I self-studied the course from Coursera and the Barron's books. If you're reading this and are in high-school, I highly recommend taking it, as getting a '5' is not very hard and
   it allows you to get placed out of the strict Calc I & II requirements and jump directly to Calc III (Calc I, II can easily be self-studied, so you don't have to spend 1 or 2 semester(s) with them.)</p>
