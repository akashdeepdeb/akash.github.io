<h1> Course Material</h1>
<p>
  I decided to make this section for one reason - to share the resources I used for learning subjects in Math, CS and ECE. These are all the important courses I have taken at UIUC and elsewhere. You'll find materials and resources that should help you for them. 
  I have not provided the links for some textbooks and sources to avoid copyright issues. However, if you have any questions about them, feel free to contact me <a href = "/contact"><b>here</b></a>.
