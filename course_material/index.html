  I decided to make this section for one reason - to share the resources I used for learning subjects in Math, CS and ECE. These are all the important courses I have taken at UIUC and elsewhere. You'll find materials and resources that should help you for them.
  I have not provided the links for some textbooks and sources to avoid any issues. However, if you have any questions about where to find/get the textbooks, feel free to contact me <a href = "/contact"><b>here</b></a> or (warning!) just click the links 3:-)

<h3>
  AP and proficiency credit
</h3>
<p>
I started my freshman year with 19 credits. Looking back, I did well to take the 3 AP Exams - Calc BC, Physics C: E&M, Chemistry, and the PHYS 211 Proficiency test.
Since I wanted to be a CompE, this allowed me to get out of the following courses: MATH 221, 231, PHYS 211, 212, CHEM 102, 103, 104; so, I didn’t <em>have</em> to take AP Computer Science A since CS 125 wasn’t required for my major.

   <p><b>Course Review</b><br> When I was in high-school, I didn't actually take this course since I was in a different curriculum. However, I self-studied the course from Coursera and the Barron's books. If you're reading this and are in high-school, I highly recommend taking it, as getting a '5' is not very hard and
   it allows you to get placed out of the strict Calc I & II requirements and jump directly to Calc III (Calc I, II can easily be self-studied, so you don't have to spend 1 or 2 semester(s) with them.)</p>

   <p><b>Course Review</b><br>
   As with Calc BC, I hadn't taken this course formally (just the test.) I mostly prepared for it from the Barron's book and took time off from school to
   get help from professors. Other than that I watched MIT OCW's lectures online and Rice University's online edX course - both of which were extremely helpful. Doing 5-7 practice tests (basically, till your concepts are clear) is probably the best way to get a 5 in the test.

   <p><b>Course Review</b><br>
   In my Junior year of high-school, I had formally taken MIT's 8.01 Classical Mechanics on edX, taught by <em>the</em> great physics professor, Walter Lewin. It is perhaps the best course I have ever taken and 8.01's course quality is still unparalleled. Anyways, with 2 days left to prepare, I re-viewed all 36 hours of Classical Mechanics videos on YouTube and somehow passed the proficiency test.
   A stroke of luck you say? Maybe. Maybe not. When I took the test, I knew I had given many right answers because I got those answers mostly on first go. All in all, the test wasn't very hard. So, to prepare for it, you can watch Walter Lewin's lecture videos on YouTube.

<h3>
  Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
These and some additional courses amounted to a 16 credit hours first semester. Honestly, this semester was a pain in the neck. I can think of a few reasons: Firstly, this was my first semester in US, this took some time to get adjusted to. I was stumped by the amount of homework we had to submit online and how strict the university was with homework deadlines. I recall missing many homework deadlines for PHYS 214 - something I corrected while taking PHYS 213 (which understandably resulted in a better grade in the course.) Secondly, I hadn’t done any past papers - back in high school this wasn’t very important. Although, in University, one of the best ways to prepare for any exam is to solve past exams.

    <p><b>Review</b><br>
    ECE 110 is a good intro. to electrical engineering.
    However, I still think it is too easy - ECE 110 an 120 should be taken together, if possible, since, this allows one to take ECE 210, 220, 313 in the second semester if need be.
    The homeworks/exams are trivial if one has understood the concepts.
    If you are looking to get an A+ in this class, attend all classes, as each class has iClicker sessions.
    Also, do the past papers - during Fall 2015, many questions were the same.

    This is a good starting math course. Homeworks weren’t too bad.
    When I didn’t get some concepts, I just looked up Paul’s Online Math Notes and went to Office Hours.
    CARE was quite useful sometimes. I am going to tutor at CARE for Fall 2016, so you should come ;)

   <p><b>Review</b><br>
    This was my first lecture at UIUC. I liked it. It felt a lot like the 8.01x course I had taken online 2 (now, 3) years ago.
    The course is 2 credit hours for 7 actual hours/wk. I didn't use any additional references for this; tips: solve many past papers, attend all discussions and review sessions.

   This course was almost similar to PHYS 214. Here, however, I learnt from the 214 mistakes and, hence, learnt more from the course. Follow the same tips above.

<h3>
  Spring 2016
</h3>
<p>
  My second semester felt really easy. Made many great friends; even though it was all technical and I was quite occupied with finishing homework, taking 3 ECE classes and one math class was a lot of fun!
  I learnt a lot; it was perhaps the interest I had in the subjects and the new things I was learning each day (not only in academia, but life in general,) that made Spring '16 a lot more exciting than Fall '15.

      <br>
      <hr width = "40%">
      <p><b>Review</b><br>
        ECE 120 is a great Computing intro. course. The first month is pretty easy; it's after the third month that it gets a tad bit confusing (albeit, very enjoyable and intuitive if understood clearly.)
        In ECE 120, all concepts are connected; so, if you think you haven't understood any topic properly, make sure to cover it up quickly so the advanced topics in finite state automata do not stump you.
        I didn't exactly use any extra sources for the course. I used Prof. Kindratenko's notes mostly and watched some videos on SR Latch, FSMs etc. For reference, I am posting some of my lab code; hopefully, it will give you an idea of what LC-3 programs look like and help you understand the beautiful and great Von-Nuemann LC-3 architecture.

      <p><b>Review</b><br>
        ECE 210 introduces electronics in the first month and then delves into Communication Systems.
        A good part of the course is just exams: 75% and the rest is homework and labs.
        So, be up-to-date with what's being taught as it is very easy to lose track and, consequently, lose interest.
        Professor Eden recommended the book provided in the reference - it is a good book with lots of nice questions. :-)

      <p><b>Review</b><br>
        I didn't find many freshmen taking the course. I took the course since I didn't have anything else to take and I wanted to take a technical course (and not a liberal elective.)
        The course covers the basics of probability in the beginning and then moves on to discrete random variables (RVs), then continuous RVs and finally jointly distributed RVs. Finishing this course allows you to take many advanced techincal electives in EE.
        A lot of the concepts taught here are industry relevant topics which branch off to subjects like Machine Learning, Communications Systems, Systems Reliability and much much more!
        I'll link some books I referenced and the cheatsheets I used.

      <p><b>Review</b><br>
        I was glad I was taking the course with Prof. Albin. Initially the course covers first order differential equations which isn't very hard; mid-way, it drifts to linear algebra and finally, covers a bit of Laplace equations and Sturm Liouville problems.
        The course book was all I needed for this course and hence, I link it in the references.
