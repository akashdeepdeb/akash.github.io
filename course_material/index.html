  I decided to make this section for one reason - to share the resources I used for learning subjects in Math, CS and ECE. These are all the important courses I have taken at UIUC and elsewhere. You'll find materials and resources that should help you for them. 
  I have not provided the links for some textbooks and sources to avoid copyright issues. However, if you have any questions about where to find/get the textbooks, feel free to contact me <a href = "/contact"><b>here</b></a>.

<h3>
  AP and proficiency credit
</h3>
<p>
I started my freshman year with 19 credits. Looking back, I did well to take the 3 AP Exams - Calc BC, Physics C: E&M, Chemistry, and the PHYS 211 Proficiency test.
Since I wanted to be a CompE, this allowed me to get out of the following courses: MATH 221, 231, PHYS 211, 212, CHEM 102, 103, 104; so, I didn’t <em>have</em> to take AP Computer Science A since CS 125 wasn’t required for my major.

   <p><b>Course Review</b><br> When I was in high-school, I didn't actually take this course since I was in a different curriculum. However, I self-studied the course from Coursera and the Barron's books. If you're reading this and are in high-school, I highly recommend taking it, as getting a '5' is not very hard and
   it allows you to get placed out of the strict Calc I & II requirements and jump directly to Calc III (Calc I, II can easily be self-studied, so you don't have to spend 1 or 2 semester(s) with them.)</p>

   <p><b>Course Review</b><br>
   As with Calc BC, I hadn't taken this course formally (just the test.) I mostly prepared for it from the Barron's book and took time off from school to 
   get help from professors. Other than that I watched MIT OCW's lectures online and Rice University's online edX course - both of which were extremely helpful. Doing 5-7 practice tests (basically, till your concepts are clear) is probably the best way to get a 5 in the test.

   <p><b>Course Review</b><br>
   In my Junior year of high-school, I had formally taken MIT's 8.01 Classical Mechanics on edX, taught by <em>the</em> great physics professor, Walter Lewin. It is perhaps the best course I have ever taken and 8.01's course quality is still unparalleled. Anyways, with 2 days left to prepare, I re-viewed all 36 hours of Classical Mechanics videos on YouTube and somehow passed the proficiency test. 
   A stroke of luck you say? Maybe. Maybe not. When I took the test, I knew I had given many right answers because I got those answers mostly on first go. All in all, the test wasn't very hard. So, to prepare for it, you can watch Walter Lewin's lecture videos on YouTube.

<h3>
  Fall 2015
</h3>
<p>
These and some additional courses amounted to a 16 credit hours first semester. Honestly, this semester was a pain in the neck. I can think of a few reasons: Firstly, this was my first semester in US, this took some time to get adjusted to. I was stumped by the amount of homework we had to submit online and how strict the university was with homework deadlines. I recall missing many homework deadlines for PHYS 214 - something I corrected while taking PHYS 213 (which understandably resulted in a better grade in the course.) Secondly, I hadn’t done any past papers - back in high school this wasn’t very important. Although, in University, one of the best ways to prepare for any exam is to solve past exams.

    <p><b>Review</b><br>
    ECE 110 is a good intro. to electrical engineering. 
    However, I still think it is too easy - ECE 110 an 120 should be taken together, if possible, since, this allows one to take ECE 210, 220, 313 in the second semester if need be. 
    The homeworks/exams are trivial if one has understood the concepts. 
    If you are looking to get an A+ in this class, attend all classes, as each class has iClicker sessions.  
    Also, do the past papers - during Fall 2015, many questions were the same.

    <p><b>Review</b><br>
    This is a good starting math course. Homeworks weren’t too bad. 
    When I didn’t get some concepts, I just looked up Paul’s Online Math Notes and went to Office Hours. 
    CARE was quite useful sometimes. I am going to tutor at CARE for Fall 2016, so you should come ;)
