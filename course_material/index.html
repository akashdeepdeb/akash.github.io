<h1> course material</h1>
<p>
  These are all the important courses I have taken at UIUC and elsewhere. You'll find materials and resources that will help you prepare for them. 
  I have not provided the links for some textbooks and sources to avoid copyright issues. However, if you have any questions about them, feel free to contact me.
