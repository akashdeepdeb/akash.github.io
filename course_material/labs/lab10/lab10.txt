QUESTION 1.  Read through the program lab10.bin. What do you expect the program to do? More specifically, which register will the program modify when it is run, and what will it contain when the program finishes? (You can probably figure this out merely by reading the comments provided in lab10.bin.)

ANSWER: The program first specifies where the program will be stored. Then it clears the register R2 by ANDing it with x00000 and adds the decimal number 12 to register R2 and halts. The program modifies register R2 when the the program finishes. 


QUESTION 2.  Explain in a few sentences why the ability to step through a program (run one instruction at a time) is a very useful tool for debugging a program. Debugging is the process of finding and correcting bugs (or errors) in a program. Hint: Finding a bug is often much more difficult than correcting it.

ANSWER: Since LC3 is written in 0s and 1s, the way to find out bugs can often be very confusing and difficult. The step function is often more useful, then, to find the bugs, if any. This is because it allows us to traverse through the entire code by going through it line-by-line and see where our registers may give us false readings or readings not expected: this is helpful since it allows us to debug the entire program quite easily.
